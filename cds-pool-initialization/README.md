# CDS Pool Initialization Component

## Overview

This component handles the initialization of Credit Default Swap (CDS) token pools in the Merchant Crypto Advance AMM system. It implements risk-based pricing, liquidity seeding, and dynamic price adjustment mechanisms.

## Key Features

- **Risk-Based Pricing**: CDS tokens priced according to credit risk metrics
- **Liquidity Seeding**: Automatic initial liquidity provision for tradeability
- **Dynamic Price Adjustment**: Real-time price updates based on changing risk factors
- **Mento Integration**: Seamless integration with Celo's stablecoin ecosystem
- **Micro-Finance Optimized**: Designed for small-scale merchant transactions

## Core Components

### 1. CDSPoolInitializer
Main contract responsible for pool creation and initialization.

### 2. RiskCalculator
Handles risk-based price calculations using merchant credit metrics.

### 3. LiquidityManager
Manages initial liquidity seeding and ongoing liquidity provision.

### 4. PriceOracle
Provides price updates and market data integration.

## Integration Points

- **CDSFactory**: Creates and initializes pools during CDS token creation
- **MerchantDataMediator**: Coordinates merchant onboarding with pool creation
- **Mento Protocol**: Integrates with Celo's stablecoin selection system
- **Algebra Protocol**: Uses Algebra's custom pool creation mechanisms

## Usage

```solidity
// Initialize a new CDS pool
address pool = poolInitializer.initializeCDSPool(
    cdsToken,
    stablecoin,
    metrics,
    totalSupply
);
```
