# Problem

The global micro-finance sector faces significant challenges in serving small-scale merchants and micro-entrepreneurs, particularly in emerging markets. Traditional micro-finance institutions struggle with high operational costs (15-30% of loan value), limited scalability due to manual processes, and difficulties in assessing creditworthiness due to lack of formal credit histories. Additionally, there's a critical gap in privacy-preserving financial services that can scale with business growth while maintaining data sovereignty. The integration of blockchain technology, specifically Automated Market Makers (AMMs) with privacy-preserving identity verification, presents a transformative opportunity to address these systemic issues while enabling financial inclusion for underserved merchant populations.

# Description

This system integrates multiple protocols to create a comprehensive micro-finance solution for merchants:

**Algebra Protocol**: Provides the core AMM infrastructure for creating and managing liquidity pools between CDS tokens and stable assets. The AlgebraFactory creates custom pools for each merchant's credit default swap (CDS) token paired with optimal stablecoins.

**Mento Protocol**: Supplies stablecoin infrastructure and selection logic through the MentoStableCoinSelector, ensuring merchants receive the most appropriate stablecoin based on their geographic location and business profile. The protocol provides stability assurance for merchant operations.

**Self Protocol**: Enables privacy-preserving identity verification through zero-knowledge proofs. Merchants can prove their creditworthiness and business legitimacy without revealing sensitive financial data, addressing key privacy concerns in micro-finance.

**ERC-6909 Multi-Token Standard**: Enables the CDS token system to function as a unified credit scoring mechanism. This standard allows a single contract to manage multiple token types (different credit profiles) while maintaining separate metadata, supply calculations, and transfer logic for each merchant's unique credit assessment. The multi-token architecture enables efficient gas usage and flexible token management within the AMM pools.

# Solution Description

The solution centers around **CDS (Credit Default Swap) tokens** as tokenized credit scoring systems that represent a merchant's creditworthiness and business risk profile. Each CDS token is minted based on comprehensive merchant metrics including financial health, business fundamentals, and risk factors.

**CDS Token Mechanics**: CDS tokens are ERC-6909 multi-token standard tokens that represent a merchant's credit profile. The token supply is calculated using a sophisticated algorithm that considers financial health scores, credit risk multipliers, market adjustments, and business factors. Higher creditworthiness results in more tokens, enabling better access to liquidity.

**Algebra Pool Integration**: Each CDS token is paired with an optimal stablecoin (selected via Mento Protocol) in a dedicated Algebra AMM pool. These pools enable:
- **Liquidity Provision**: Protection sellers can provide liquidity against CDS tokens
- **Price Discovery**: Market-driven pricing of credit risk through trading activity
- **Liquidation Mechanisms**: Automated risk management through pool-based liquidation

**Loan Lifecycle**: 
1. **Onboarding**: Merchants complete identity verification via Self Protocol
2. **CDS Creation**: CDS tokens are minted based on merchant metrics and credit assessment
3. **Pool Creation**: Algebra pools are created for CDS/stablecoin pairs
4. **Liquidity Provision**: Protection sellers provide liquidity to pools
5. **Trading & Risk Management**: Continuous price discovery and risk adjustment
6. **Liquidation**: Automated liquidation mechanisms protect against defaults

The system enables micro-finance at scale while preserving merchant privacy and providing transparent, market-driven credit assessment.

# Mission

Enable micro-finance for underserved merchants through privacy-preserving, blockchain-based credit assessment and automated market making, fostering financial inclusion while maintaining data sovereignty and reducing operational costs.
